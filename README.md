Machine Learning Concepts Chatbot
Project Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for a Machine Learning Concepts Chatbot, an advanced chatbot designed to facilitate the learning and understanding of concepts from "Introduction to Statistical Learning". This chatbot integrates cutting-edge technologies like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LangChain, and FAISS, offering an interactive and informative platform for users to explore machine learning topics.
Key Features

    RAG Integration: Combines the generative power of the Llama 2 language model with a document retrieval system, allowing the chatbot to augment its responses with relevant and up-to-date information.
    LangChain Utilization: Orchestrates complex language capabilities to enhance the chatbot's conversational context and relevance.
    FAISS-Powered Retrieval: Employs FAISS for efficient and fast retrieval of text data, ensuring the chatbot can quickly access the needed information from its database.
    User-Friendly Interface: Built using Streamlit, the interface is intuitive, making it easy for users to interact with the chatbot and receive accurate responses to their queries.
    Educational Focus: Specifically designed to aid in learning machine learning concepts, making it a valuable tool for students and enthusiasts.

Technologies Used

Installation and Setup

Instructions for setting up the project:

    Clone the repository to your local machine.
    Install the required Python packages using pip install -r requirements.txt.
    Set up a Google Colab environment with a T4 GPU for optimal performance.
    Run the Streamlit application to interact with the chatbot.

Usage

After setting up the project, users can start the Streamlit application and interact with the chatbot. Simply enter your queries related to machine learning concepts, and the chatbot will respond with information derived from "Introduction to Statistical Learning" and other relevant sources.
Testing and Evaluation

The chatbot has undergone preliminary spot checks to assess its response quality and reliability. Future work includes setting up a more systematic evaluation framework for comprehensive performance analysis.
